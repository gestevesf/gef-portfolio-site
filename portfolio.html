            <h3>Business Challenge</h3>
            <p>OSICA is a brand created with the partnership of the artist and sculpturist Carlos Oliveira.</p>
            <p>It was created with the purpose of bringing original and classic sneakers, loved by sneakershead and many others around the world, to an art form that can be preserved forever. Ceramic.</p>
            <p>WIth the growing sneaker market, streetwear fashion and now the  NFT’s, it comes along the temporary art. And what better way to allow art collectors and sneakerheads that collect sneakers (that end up fall apart some years after), than having a sneaker and piece or art that can be displayed anywhere, at any condition, without needing to worry about its life time.</p>
            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>I am the founder of this brand. As the only employe, I’m responsible for the creation of the brand, management of stock, web design, marketing strategy, sustainable operations and production activities. I’m also responsible for finding the right partners and companies that align with the goal of the brand and want to be part of the project.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Traditional Portuguese Ceramic</h3>
            <p>Portugal has been using ceramic since the XV century, and since then it has developed different processes and ways of creating countless everyday objects, pieces of art and many more. And being around by so many of this objects in my house, and even looking at priceless pieces that have endured hundreds of years and belonged to mmy great-grandparents. Made me think that was possible to create modern works of art that people could enjoy and pass on for years later.</p>
            <h3>Sneakers</h3>
            <p>I’ve been very passion about sneakers since I was kid, and enjoy having some of them more clean and less used than others becasue I felt that they were more valuable, or rare, than others. But even though they were more valuable, I still wanted to use those shoes, I wanted to show them off even if that meant ruin them or getting them dirty.</p>

            <h3>Sneaker in Ceramic</h3>
            <p>So I though, why can’t we have these rare sneakers as an art piece, as an object that can’t get dirty or ruined because of use? It was definitely possible, and the answer was there right in front of me for a long time. Creating and replicating the rare sneakers that would leave the sneakerheads afraid of ruining them, would be possible using the ancient ceramic tecniques that had been passed along in Portugal for centuries.</p>

            <h3>Finding a Sculpturist</h3>
            <p>The idea was there, but how could I replicate these sneakers in ceramic? I knew a lot about sneakers, but I didn’t know anything about ceramic. I had know idea where to start and how to accomplish this difficult task.</p>
            <p>So I went searching and found Carlos Oliveira, a sculpturist born and raised in Caldas da Rainha (the capital of ceramic in Portugal). I’ve exposed to him my idea, and asked him if it would be possible to bring this idea to life. I explained him the value that sneakers have and how there is a huge community searching and collecting so many sneakers. And he explained me what ceramic was, how it was made, the different processes, cooking temperatures and so much more. I’ve learned almost everything there is to know about ceramics in 2 whole months.</p>
            <h3>First Trials</h3>
            <p>We went on and tried to replicate with an original Air Max 1 from Nike. Because Carlos thought it was very difficult to create a mold, made out of plaster (the only material that can absorb the humidity of clay in liquid form) with the shoelaces on, so we have removed them from the original shoe.</p>

            <h3>Errors & Mistakes</h3>
            <p>Without even knowing, we were making a few mistakes. But this was only possible to see when we could take our first example and prototype. </p>
            <p>Because the plaster is so much heavier than the textil materials of the shoe, the shoe deformed when pouring the plaster over. As this wasn’t visible in the mold, we didn’t realize this. Another mistake was the tongue of the shoe, The tong was impossible to keep still during the creation of the mold, and this made an unprecise and weird look to the prototype. And finally, the fact that the protoype didn’t had shoelaces, made the replica very different from the original shoe.</p>

            <h3>Changes & Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>So now, that we knew it was possible to accomplish this idea. We just needed to make it perfect, exacly the same as the original. Because without this it would be very difficult to reach my potential customers, that expect and want perfect products and the maximum details.</p>
            <p>So we went again and have changed everything that leaded us to the first failed attempt. I’ve molded clay in the interior of the shoe to make sure that the plaster would not deform the materials. I’ve attached the tong in the center of the shoe and I’ve added and arranged the laces to look perfect in the prototype. The result... Was perfect!</p>

            <h3>Name & Logo</h3>
            <p>I now knew that was possible to replicate a sneaker in ceramic. So I needed a name for this project and a logo that could be placed in my product. I’ve brainstormed for days, trying to find the right name, looking at “sneaker vocabulary”, but couldn’t like any name or word I’ve seen. So I’ve decided to create my own word, my own name, and using simbolic words that matched my product and idea. I’ve came up with OSICA, meaning, Original Sneakers In Ceramic Art.</p>
            <p>Since I didn’t have any background in graphic design, I have asked a professional to design me a logo that could match the name of the brand and the values I wanted to pass along. I’ve chosen blue as the primary color as a simbolism to the traditional Portuguese ceramic, that since a long time was painted in blue over white tiles.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>This business showed me the <span class="bold-grey">different challenges of creating a product and a brand</span> from scrach and that it is definitely not so easy as I thought. Since I add no partners I had to learn everything from scratch.</p>
            <p>It is very hard to fullfil ideas without knowing all the tecniques and steps behind it, so I had to <span class="bold-grey">understand everything behind the product</span> to make sure the final result goes on account <span class="bold-grey">with what the customers can expect for and it goes on account with the values of the brand</span>.</p>
            <p>This helped understand <span class="bold-grey">how important it is to maintain a constant contact and communication</span> with suppliers. If I’m not pressuring, everything will move very slow, deadlines are not taking serious, or the quality control is not met.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-grey">How hard it is to maintain and create new content</span>, it takes a lot of time to be in contact with influenciers, creating new connections, how important is to constaintly share content in social media.</p>
            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>The production, the paints, and the packaging are all aligned with what I was ideating. However, finding a precise painter that is available to spend time and patience to paint these art pieces is hard and I still feel that this part can be improved.</p>
            <p>The next step will be to focus on creating and sharing content, will be to expose the brand and the product to reach more people and potential customers. To be able to fullfil this, I’ll focus on Instagram, getting emails and advertising through social media.</p>
            <p>Finally, with the first returns, I will be investing in new machinary to improved the product’s quality and will be creating new sneaker models and products to expand the inventory and sell to a biggeer audience.</p>
            <p>I want OSICA to be a responsible brand and I also focus making sure our packaging is sustainable.</p>

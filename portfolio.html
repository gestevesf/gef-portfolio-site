            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The following overview describes the processes, insights, and learning from my project for Career Foundry’s UX Design course and further Web Development for Designers specialization.</p>
            <p>This showcases all steps that were taken to build my main project which is the Portfolio Website. This final project is where I present my UX Design projects, using the Design Process, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>I am the founder of this brand. As the only employe, I’m responsible for the creation of the brand, management of stock, web design, marketing strategy, sustainable operations and production activities. I’m also responsible for finding the right partners and companies that align with the goal of the brand and want to be part of the project.</p>
            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>September 2021 - November 2021</p>

            <h3>Who?</h3>
            <p>I have completed this project and built my portfolio from scratch so that I can show who I am, my values, my passions, my work as a UX designer, and what I’m looking to be in the future.</p>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>I went through a career change to UX Design this year. I wanted to imagine and create products with people in mind and made for people since they are the real users of all products.</p>
            <p>As a UX Designer, I will need to communicate a lot with developers during the design process of new products. With that in mind, I wanted to learn how to communicate with them, to know how they work and what they need to make prototypes and live products. I wanted to understand their limitations behind creating a real project and to know how to transfer assets the right way so that the work can be more fluid and more efficient.</p>
            <p>Saving time means saving money!</p>
            <h3>Where?</h3>
            <p>It was thought of and coded from home and from scratch. I could have used an online platform like Squarespace to create it, but doing it on my own would not only allow me to learn new skills but also to understand how to implement them later during my professional career.</p>
            <h3>When?</h3>
            <p>After concluding my UX Design course at CareerFoundry, the portfolio took about two months to finish under the guideline of the Frontend Web Development specialization for designers.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>The goal was to create a responsive portfolio website so that I would have a proper platform to showcase my projects and experiences to hiring managers for potential job opportunities. The aim was to learn and understand basic code, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from a UX Design point of view.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>In order to create and imagine possible portfolio designs, I did lots of research and looked through some of the best portfolios out there. I observed what they were doing right, what I liked and disliked about each of them, and realistically thought about what I would be able to code. Since I was only learning the basics of some coding languages and the time was tight, I had to be sure it would be possible to complete the portfolio by the deadline.</p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Grabbing the most interesting parts from my research, I started to create a base model of what my portfolio could look like and what I had in mind.</p>
            <p>As a primary structure, I needed to think and decide on what content to display, what to include, what sections it would be divided in and what would be the main features of the portfolio:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Home page - show off my work and projects</li>
              <li>About me - tell my story, where I came from, and my career change journey</li>
              <li>Projects/work - explain my role, the main challenges I faced, and all my learnings</li>
              <li>Contact - display all forms of contact for people to reach me</li>
            </ol>
            <p>On the more visual side, I prepared all the images that I wanted to integrate into my portfolio website. This was major as I had to make sure all images were of high-quality formats, compressed, and organized in the right folders in order for smooth delivery to the developer’s team.</p>

            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>I chose the colors based on my preferences and overall feeling while keeping in mind the contrast and ensuring colors would be inclusive and accessible for every single user that visited my website.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I created a logo using my initials to display on the website. This was not only a way to add a personal touch to my portfolio but also a way to relate to my roots as this logo letter combination (GEF) was how I identified myself a while ago in social media, games, etc.</p>

            <h3>Mockups</h3>
            <p>It was very tough for me, as a UX Designer, to try and imagine how my website could look while not yet having a great perception of how to code and what to write.</p>
            <p>So, thinking like a proper UX Designer, before delivering the folder to the developer (in this case, me as well), I made wireframes on how the website and structure should look like.</p>
            <p>I came up with some ideas during the wireframing phase which included: all the information in just one page, open pages overlaying the ‘Home’ page, etc... Nevertheless, as I was learning Web Development, I started to understand some of the limitations that the web has. Having all the information on one page could result in a very slow opening of the website which could throw off some hiring managers. Overlaying pages on a mobile screen could result in the information being small and difficult to read for many potential users. Thus, I understood some changes to my initial design project were needed.</p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>As I already had my wireframes, the images, and the files I needed all organized in a proper way as a UX Designer should, I started coding. I created and wrote all the <span class="bold-grey">HTML</span> files (4 pages in total for my website) that define the structure and the skeleton of the website.</p>
            <p>After that was completed, I moved on to the styling phase with <span class="bold-grey">CSS</span>. This would define the layout of the page which would be the skin to the website.</p>
            <p>At this point, I felt proud of myself. I had come a long way since the beginning of 2021 and I could really see my learnings turning into real-life small products.</p>
            <p>Next was <span class="bold-grey">JavaScript</span> which I knew would be the most challenging. As I had only learned the basics, I implemented only a few small but essential interactions and movements to my portfolio that would make it all come to life.</p>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>With the portfolio ready, designed using the mobile-first approach, and then scaling to tablet and laptop size it was time to move forward.</p>
            <p>Before being published, every project needs to be tested by potential users. I cannot trust only my knowledge and my designs because like everyone else I make mistakes. For that reason, it would be required to have other people’s feedback on the looks and feels of the website and testing its functionality. This would allow me to get insightful inputs on what to change that I otherwise would not be able to get.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Browsing Testing</h3>
            <p>With all-new updates in place, the website was almost ready. However, even though during my project I was simultaneously using Chrome and Safari, it was still important to test it on the other main browsers (Firefox, Opera, Brave, etc.) and in all different screen sizes (for multiple devices). This was necessary as some functionalities from JavaScript or CSS do not work the same for all these browsers.</p>

            <p>In the end, I was able to reach my goal and get a well-functioning portfolio that I can now easily use to apply for job opportunities. Employers can quickly understand who I am, what I have done, and what I am looking for.</p>
            <p>I used my UX Design insights and knowledge and combined them with the skills I learned from Web Development to be able to build a responsive portfolio designed by me with a mobile-first mentality and accessibility in mind.</p>
            <p>I went through the user testing process and received valuable feedback from 5 participants. Based on the results from these tests, I improved some functionalities of my project and created a list of future iterations.</p>
            <p>I wrote my code using Atom and I checked it for errors using linters while also testing throughout the major browsers.</p>

            <p>I gained many new skills, the most important being <span class="bold-grey">the impact of UX Design insights in the developing processes</span>.</p>
            <p>I was able to fully comprehend the <span class="bold-grey">essential assets needed by the developers</span> and how to properly combine that in folders for smooth handovers. I am now capable of <span class="bold-grey">communicating easily</span> with them while being <span class="bold-grey">aware of the web limitations in the creating products’ process</span>.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the industry, some things are common across all projects: we always keep a <span class="bold-grey">mobile-first approach</span> during the design phase, we are always focused and working for <span class="bold-grey">Human-Centered Design</span>, and we <span class="bold-grey">test and keep testing</span> until people are fully satisfied with our results.</p>
            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>I cannot close this initial learning chapter without thanking my Mentor, Carlo van der Pluijm, who helped me and guided me along the way throughout this project.</p>
            <p>And I would also like to give credit to StorySet by Freepik for making the illustrations that I used in this case study available for all.</p>

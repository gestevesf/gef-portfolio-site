            <h3>Project Challenge</h3>
            <p>Sneaker Help is an app created during my UX course at CareerFoundry.</p>
            <p>It is designed to allow users to know the hyped sneakers and fashion releases, find the best stores in town and instantly connect with fashion stylists that can
              help them find perfect outfits for any occasion.</p>
            <p>The growing sneakers market is making it very hard for its customers to keep up and knowing all the time which sneakers are releasing and when. So instead of following inumerous
              instagram pages, Sneaker Help can let them know which sneakers are releasing, when and where to buy them.</p>
            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>As a solo designer, I was responsible for the entire design process which included the competitive analysis, user interviews, surveys, personas, user journey maps, card sorting, information architecture, sketches, wireframes, user
              flows, usability testing and A/B testing, the stylie guide and prototyping.</p>
            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>February 2021 - September 2021</p>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Sneakerheads and fashion enthusiasts need a way to find sneakers and clothes, because they want to stand out in their offices, events, street or to their friends.</p>
            <p>We will know this to be true when we see how many users have signed up, how they search for stores and how many sessions have been booked with our stylists.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>At the begining of the project, I’ve researched other apps offering similar functions and services to understand what already existed on the market.</p>
            <p>I’ve downloaded, tested and performed a competitive analysis on two great competitors for Sneaker Help, Wishi and SneakerJagers.</p>
            <p>My objective was to identify the opportunities and areas for improvement in the market. For this I’ve realized a SWOT analysis for both apps so I could understand which unique features my app could have and what should be avoided.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>It is possible to give the sneaker community a viable, competitive and innovative web-application.</li>
              <li>Including more brands and products could reach more users.</li>
              <li>A more personalized search can facilitate the user’s search.</li>
              <li>Having more stores and detailed infomation can help users make better and informed decisions on where to buy.</li>

            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
            <p>After, it was time for me to observe and see what potential users had to say in this topic. For that I’ve delined my main research goals on what I wanted to find more about:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>User behavior and the activity of buying sneakers and clothes.</li>
              <li>Collect data points to later analyse with the problem statement.</li>
              <li>How users expect the stylists to help them.</li>
              <li>Features users would like in a stylist sneaker app.</li>
              <li>Apps and websites that the users enjoy/don’t enjoy to buy sneakers and clothes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Interviews & Surveys</h3>
            <p>So, I’ve first realized a qualitative research and did 4 interviews to potential users, over Skype, to better understand their behaviors, and secondly I’ve created a survey, answered by 34 people in 24h to collect quantitative data to prove if the data taken from the interviews was correct.</p>

            <p>Now that I had my personas and possible user flows delined, I was able to draft a first sitemap based on the information I gathered from the personas and the requirements that Sneaker Help needed.<br>To ensure that this sitemap was understandable, I conducted a open card sorting study in OptimalSort.</p>
            <p>By doing a Card Sorting study, I was able to get important information on how possible users would see the application. I was separating every information and topic in each category, while the participants from this study showed and prefer to see the information more organized in fewer categories. With this information, I was able to create a more organized sitemap for the application, where the possible users could understand it better and faster how to navigate it.</p>

            <p>I’ve sketched the possible screens for the three main actions a user can take in the application, like using the Home Page to see the most recent updates on sneaker releases and news in the sneaker and fashion world. From there they could navigate through the app and search for sneakers, clothing and search for stylists.</p>

            <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Always keeping in mind the Mobile-First design, I’ve used Adobe XD to design the mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
            <p>I’ve tried to change the menu bar and use a burger menu, to see how this could work. However, even though it gave me more screen size to work with, It felt that the menu navigation bar could give the users a faster navigation through the main features of the app.</p>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>I’ve kept using Adobe XD to design these High-Fidelity wireframes.</p>
            <p>I’ve changed the menu back to the navigation bar. I’ve used simple pastel colors to give the design a more modern and younger look, keeping it minimalist, easy to understand, and navigate so the users don’t need too much information on how to get around the app.</p>
            <p>At this point there are still some features to be included in the design, as in this stage I’ve given more focus to the three main features of the app so it could be used in the user testing as fast as possible.</p>

            <p>For the usability tests, I’ve recruited 6 participants. 5 tests were conducted in-person, while the other test was conducted remotely throught Zoom.</p>
            <p>All participants are representative of the target users. They are between the ages of 27 and 36 years old, with different backgrounds and are used to buy clothes and sneakers online.</p>

            <p class="box">The goal of these tests was to assess the learnability of new users interacting with the Sneaker Help app for the first time. I’ve measured and observed if they understandood the value of the app, and its core features. Such as, signing up, searching for a product (sneaker), search for an expert and book a session with an expert.</p>

            <h3>Feedback & Changes</h3>
            <p>After conducting the usability tests and analyzing the results I was able to see important pain points that need to be changed. Since most of the difficulties the participants had were from navigation and buttons placed in the wrong place.</p>
            <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
            <p>After the usability tests and making all the changes the participants have suggested, I’ve conducted two preference tests using Usability Hub. Participants were asked to choose between 2 similar designs and why they have made that choice.</p>
            <p>One on the Sign Up/Login screen and the second on the first Onboarding screen. I thought it was important to place this two tests to see if the participants would preferer to see less information and bigger pictures on the screens or if they prefer more empty space with explanatory text.</p>

            <p>This project showed me <span class="bold-grey">the different challenges of creating an entire product from scrach</span> and <span class="bold-grey">how the original ideas and goals can change so much from the beginning to the end</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-grey">It is very hard, or impossible, to evaluate success without the proper testing from potencial users</span>. So the main improvements only came after the user testings, where participants were able to identify small, but frustrating problems and pain points.</p>
            <p>This project helped me to understand <span class="bold-grey">how important user testing is</span> early on in the begining stages of prototyping and how important the users feedback is for the development of every project.</p>
            <p>Not forgetting as well <span class="bold-grey">the importance of working in a team, the feedback and opinion of other designers</span> cannot be forgotten, because since I’ve been designing this project from the start, <span class="bold-grey">I can get a little bit blind in my thoughts and ideas</span>, and the peers from other designers help me see and make
              important changes for the usability of this application.</p>
            <p>All these were very important changes to <span class="bold-grey">make the app more clean and user friendly</span>, but what I think was the most important actions I’ve took, was to <span class="bold-grey">have in mind the accessibility guidelines for potential users that are many times forgotten</span>.</p>
            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>Most features are very optimized and ready for development. However, in the first round of user testings I felt that none of the participants were happy or would book a stylist for a more personalized shopping experience. And I believe
              that this feature can do much more, and by creating a reward system, giving benefits and discounts to the users, would create more interaction from the users.</p>
            <p>To be able to impletement this, I’ll focus first on researching more on how can this be upgraded and more intuitive to gain more interaction and for booking sessions. I’ll do this by doing a new round of interviews and understand what the users want the stylists to do or have, and how can they be more
              helpful in finding new outfits.</p>
            <p>I’ll redesign the Stylists and the User Menu screens to implement options for the users to see their “points”, “levels” and “benefits” with the new reward system. I’ll then proceed to another round of
              user testings, focused on the Stylists section and see how this have evolved and to see if the participants’ minds have changed regarding the use of Stylists to find new outfits.</p>
